# AlphaMappings - Minecraft Alpha mappings
The mappings and the patches are currently usable with MCP v6.2
To use them, replace `conf` folder in your mcp environment, with the one provided.

The current patch works with fernflower 0.8.6 (Other versions weren't tested). You can find it in v7.0 and newer versions of MCP in `mcp_root/runtime/bin`
